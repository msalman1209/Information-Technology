      <h1>A Towering Legal Legacy</h1>
      <p>
        Sandra Day O’Connor lived an extraordinary life. As the first woman to serve on the U.S.
Supreme Court, O’Connor, who died on Friday, opened the door for the next generation of women
jurists. And during her brilliant career, she was regarded as one of the nation’s leading legal lights,
known for her dispassionate and meticulously researched opinions. Her legacy is inherent in today’s Supreme Court.
Of the 115 justices in the Court’s 234-year history, only six are women—four of whom comprise the current bench.
